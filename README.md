# greener Maps
Some Suggestions to Google Maps and the like:

- Make self-owned cars with a chauffeur no longer the default (as Google Maps and the like don't take into account that often you can't park near).
- Put more effort in getting biking and walking routes on the map (many short important connections miss, resulting in bike detours or taking the car instead)
- Take into account that you can save time by stepping of your bike and taking a shortcut where you are only allowed to walk
- differentiate in bikes,The ones going faster or a lot faster are not rare anymore (speeds vary 10-45 kph nowadays)
- Include parking (time and money) in car trips, you don't have a chauffeur, you can't stop everywhere.
- For cars show the extra green minutes people will spend to get a share/rent instead of one self-owned and mention how much people can save not owning a car.
- Allow multi-modal; more ways of transportation in one trip
   (e.g. millions in the Netherlands use a combination of biking, walking and public transportation every day)
- Give an estimate of exhaust per route option. Include the least dirty route and moment (jams and high speeds are very dirty).
- As you measure pollution, give an estimate of how much pollution you inhale during your trip (in cars air usually just came out of exhausts in front of them)
- Use satellite pictures to detect chimneys and when they're used
- Make pollution levels not a somewhat hidden value

Cars are very space inefficient, dirty (though electric vehicles pollute less) and more often than people think: slow (if you make an honest full comparison)
